# Origami Start

This project gives you a starting point for creating an Origami project.

To clone and run this repository, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/WebOrigami/origami-start
# Go into the repository
$ cd origami-start
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Run the app
$ npm start
```

This will start the Origami server on a local port; open the displayed URL to see "Hello!".

In Origami, building a project is just copying it to local files:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This will create a `build` folder containing `index.html` (and any other files you define for your site).
